# Java-Script30-Day2-Analog-Clock
I did analog clock in this project. On top of that I added some quality in my project like: numbers, set the hour, min and second scale. I also added a circle in the middle of the clock. And I added different color to hour, min and second. In this project I used date functions and I learned how to calculate the rotation of the clock properties.
